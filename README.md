# Dog vs Cat Image Classifier  

A deep learning web application that classifies whether an uploaded image is of a Dog or a Cat .  
This project is built using TensorFlow, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📌 Features  
- Upload any Dog or Cat image.  
- The model predicts whether the image is of a dog or a cat.  
- Simple, clean, and responsive frontend.  
- Built from scratch (no pre-trained models used) – implemented using CNN logic.  
- Restriction: The app only accepts dog and cat images.

## Model Download  
Since the `.h5` model file is hosted on Hugging Face.  
- Download Model(Orginal):-  [(dog_cat_model.h5)](https://huggingface.co/Subhankar002/dog-vs-cat-classifier/resolve/main/dog_cat_model.h5) 
- A compressed version of the model is also available in this GitHub repository. 

`app.py` is configured to automatically download the model from Hugging Face if it is not found locally.

## 📌 About

- This project is part of my Deep Learning experiments.
- No pre-trained model was used (like VGG16, ResNet, etc.).
- CNN was designed and trained manually.
- Accuracy achieved: 83%
- Future goal: Optimize and reach 95%+ accuracy.
